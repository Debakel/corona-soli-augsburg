*Neighbourhood aid in times of Corona*
## Dear neighbourhood,

In times of crisis it is important to stick together. You are not alone, we are happy to help you!


Are you part of the risk group for the corona disease? Are you an elderly person? Do you have a previous illness or a weak immune system? Then we would like to support you in your everyday life.


We do the shopping for you, go to the post office or pharmacy, take the dog out for a walk, or help you in other ways.  We do this for free of course – you don‘t have to pay anything. If you are worried about going out the door, please do not hesitate to accept this neighbourhood help. 


It is good to stay calm and be there for each other in times of crisis. 

Call this number if you need our help:  
**0176 390 296 95** (Alex)

We are happy to help you.

PS: Of course we are happy about everyone who would like to join us! Feel free to write us a message if you want to help.
